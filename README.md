# **E-commerce Application**

## Description

This **E-commerce Application** is a comprehensive web platform that allows users to shop for fashion products online. Built with **.NET Core MVC** for the backend and **Razor Pages** for the frontend, the application enables users to browse products, add items to the cart, proceed with checkout, and manage orders with ease.

- **Motivation:** The project was motivated by the need to create a seamless online shopping experience that combines a modern user interface with robust backend functionality.
- **Why was this built?** This project was developed to provide an intuitive and secure online shopping platform where customers can easily find and purchase fashion products. It also aims to simplify order management for administrators through a user-friendly interface.
- **Problem it solves:** The system tackles issues such as complicated checkout processes, inefficient payment integrations, and a lack of real-time inventory management.
- **What did I learn?** Through this project, I gained valuable experience in integrating **OAuth2** for Google and Facebook logins, working with payment gateways like **VNPay** and **PayPal**, managing RESTful APIs, and handling authentication and authorization with **JWT** in **.NET Core**.
